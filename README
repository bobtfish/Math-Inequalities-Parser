NAME
    Math::Inequalities::Parser - Minimum and maximum values allowed by an
    inequality.

SYNOPSIS
        use Math::Inequalities::Parser;
    
        my ($min, $max) = parse_inequality( ' 10 < n < 20 ' );
        # $min = 11
        # $max = 19

DESCRIPTION
    Trivial library for parsing integer maximum and minimum out when given
    an arbitrary inequality.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_inequality
    Parses an inequality string and returns a list of two values, the
    minimum and the maxium value that string will allow.

BUGS
    DOES NOT support the "<=" or ">=" operators. Patch very welcome.
    Does not work with negative numbers. Patches welcome.
    Always uses "n" as the number identifier, this should be configureable
    at import time.
    Uses Exporter (should use Sub::Exporter)
    DOES NOT work with floating point numbers. I consider this a feature.
