NAME
    Math::Inequalities::Parser - Minimum and maximum values allowed by an
    inequality.

SYNOPSIS
        use Math::Inequalities::Parser;
    
        my ($min, $max) = parse_inequality( ' 10 < n < 20 ' );
        # $min = 11
        # $max = 19

DESCRIPTION
    Tiny library for parsing integer maximum and minimum out when given an
    arbitrary inequality.

    Because getting this simple thing right was far harder than it looked,
    and I never want to have to think about it again.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_inequality
    Parses an inequality string and returns a list of two values, the
    minimum and the maxium value that string will allow.

TYPES OF INEQUALITY
  VALUE
    The simplest type, a single value, e.g. "42 = Min 42, Max 42".

  n < VALUE
    Maximum is VALUE - 1, Minimum is undefined, e.g. "n < 42 = Min undef,
    Max 41".

  n > VALUE
    Minimum is VALUE +1, Maximum is undefined, e.g. "n > 42 = Min 43, Max
    undef".

  n <= VALUE
    Maximum is VALUE, Minimum is undefined, e.g. "n < 42 = Min undef, Max
    42".

  n >= VALUE
    Minimum is VALUE, Maximum is undefined, e.g. "n > 42 = Min 42, Max
    undef".

  Cases with VALUE, followed by N.
    Handled as above, but with minimum and maximum reversed as expected.

  VALUE1 < n < VALUE2
    Minimum is VALUE1 + 1, maximum is VALUE2 - 1, e.g "42 < n < 200 = Min
    43, Max 199".

BUGS
    Does not handle "VALUE1 <= n <= VALUE2" or similar. Patches welcome.
    Does not complain at impossible "<VALUE1 < n < VALUE 2 "> combinations
    (e.g. "5 < n < 4") which result in a higher minumum than the maxiumum.
    Patches welcome.
    Does not work with negative numbers. Patches welcome.
    Always uses "n" as the number identifier, this should be configureable
    at import time.
    Uses Exporter (should use Sub::Exporter)
    DOES NOT work with floating point numbers. I consider this a feature.
